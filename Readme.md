Enterprise grade Vue.js 3 Dashboard suitable for CRM, MIS, ERP, Data Analytics, Business Intelligence and various other enterprise applications

Some Components

The Conversational AI component is a feature that serves as a (UI) element. 

What does it do?

 Creates an interface:
 It visually appears on the screen and provides a space (like a panel, pop-up, or area) where users can interact.

 Connects users with AI:
 It’s designed to let users communicate with an AI system. This can include asking questions, getting    recommendations, receiving auto-generated content, and more.

 Displays suggestions and prompts:
 The AI component shows AI-generated suggestions, like auto-fill texts, helpful tips, or even next steps in a task. It might also offer prompts to guide the user on what to do next (e.g., “Need help with this form?”).

Example Use Cases:

 In a shopping app, it might recommend products or answer questions about items.
 In a customer support app, it might help answer frequently asked questions.

Know how AI enables users to interact naturally with datasets

1. Natural Language Input: Users can type their questions as they would in a conversation (e.g., “Show me sales from last month” instead of writing a complex database query).
2. Intent Interpretation: The AI understands what the user is asking, even if the wording varies.
3. Query Generation: Based on the user’s intent, the AI automatically creates the right request to fetch the relevant data.

This kind of AI-driven interaction is common in chatbots, virtual assistants, and business intelligence tools.

A pivot table helps you take a big pile of data, sort it, sum it up, and view it clearly—either in a table format or as a chart—depending on how detailed or general you want the information to be.

AI can work with a Pivot Table

1. Dynamic Analysis: Users can input queries, and the AI adjusts the table accordingly.
2. Simplifies Data Insights: AI makes it easier to extract meaningful insights from complex data sets.
3. Advanced AI Capabilities: The system leverages AI to enhance data interaction and understanding

Predicting milestone task completion and project end dates using AI-driven analysis involves integrating predictive analytics and machine learning techniques into project management. Here’s how it works:

1. Data Collection & Processing
AI-driven prediction starts with gathering project data, including:
Task durations (planned vs. actual)
Dependencies between tasks
Resource availability
Past project performance data
External factors (e.g., risks, market changes)
This data is continuously updated to improve accuracy.

2. AI & Machine Learning Models
Machine learning models (such as regression models, neural networks, or time series forecasting) analyze historical and real-time project data to predict:
Milestone Completion Dates: AI estimates the probability of hitting specific milestones based on task progress and potential delays.
Project End Date: It predicts whether the overall project will finish on time or if delays might occur.

3. Integration with a Gantt Chart
The AI-driven predictions are visualized within the Gantt Chart as event markers (e.g., colored dots, vertical lines, or annotations).
These markers act as visual cues to indicate whether a task or milestone is likely to be completed on schedule or delayed.
Colors or icons can highlight on-track, at-risk, or delayed tasks, helping project managers take action.

4. Continuous Monitoring & Adjustment
As new data comes in (e.g., task progress updates or resource changes), AI refines its predictions, dynamically updating the Gantt Chart.

5. Benefits
Early Warning System: Helps teams proactively manage risks.
Improved Decision-Making: Allows project managers to adjust resources or timelines before delays happen.
Enhanced Collaboration: Stakeholders get a real-time, AI-enhanced project timeline for better coordination.

When the anomaly detection process is initiated, the system analyzes the data and identifies any anomalies based on predefined criteria. Detected anomalies are highlighted in the grid with a specific color to distinguish them from normal data, enhancing the user's ability to spot irregularities.

AI can prioritize tasks within a task collection. The AI evaluates baseline dates and scheduled taskbar dates to identify critical tasks, which are crucial for meeting project deadlines. It then reallocates resources to these critical tasks, ensuring efficient resource management and timely project completion.

AI can be used for improving the quality of the content. 

1. "Rewriting text for improved clarity and style."

This allows users to rephrase or reword their sentences so they sound more clear, concise, or elegant. For example, if a sentence is too complex or awkward, this feature can suggest a smoother, more readable version. It helps make writing easier to understand and more professional.

2. "Checking grammar to ensure correct language use."

This means the tool can identify and correct grammar mistakes like subject-verb agreement, punctuation errors, or misused words. It helps users write correctly according to standard language rules.

3. "Translating content into different languages seamlessly."

NMT AI enables users to convert their text from one language to another easily and smoothly.

Imagine you're working in a spreadsheet, and instead of writing every formula manually, AI watches what you're doing, understands the data, and:

1. suggests helpful formulas,
2. writes them for you,
3. and double-checks that they work correctly.

What is a Tree Grid?
 A Tree Grid is like a combination of a table and a tree view. It shows data in rows and columns (like a spreadsheet), but with expandable/collapsible hierarchical levels (like folders and sub-folders).

What is hierarchical data?
 This is data where items are related in a parent-child way. For example:

 A company (parent)
 Departments (children)
 Teams within departments (more children)

What does the AI do here?

 Identifies errors: Sometimes, the data might be messy or wrongly structured maybe a child is assigned to the wrong parent, or some relationships are missing.
 Corrects structure: The AI understands what the correct hierarchy should look like.
 Organizes data: It puts everything in the right order, making sure parents come before children, and nesting is logical.
 Prepares for display: After fixing everything, the data is ready to be shown in the Tree Grid — where users can expand and collapse items as needed.

AI can be integrated with Rich Text Editor for many things. For example:

1. Rephrase: Selecting this option will offer alternative phrasings for sentences to improve clarity.
2. Correct Grammar: Selecting this option will correct the grammar for the selected content.
3. Summarize: Selecting this option will summarize long documents or sections into concise versions.
4. Content Generation: Selecting this option will generate content based on selected content.
5. Translate: Selecting this will translate the selected content into the desired language based on the language selection.
